                    <h2>12 Resume mistakes and how to avoid them</h2>
                    <p>When it comes to crafting your resume, you need to sweat the small stuff. Hiring managers will be looking for every indication of your suitability. Any resume mistake can easily count against you.</p>
                    <p>In the excitement of your potential dream job appearing on the horizon, it is tempting to rush certain aspects of the application process. Perfecting your resume is the most time-consuming job search activity, so it is often the case that mistakes can creep in. Once you have sent off the resume, you won’t get a chance to correct it later.</p>
                    <p>It might seem like some of these mistakes would never surface, but it is surprising what stress can do to someone. When your brain is frazzled by fleeting moments of opportunity and the odd crushing disappointment, sometimes small resume oversights slip through.</p>
                    <p>Though they might not seem so serious at first, trust us, they could be taken as an indication of a wider malaise. If you want to give yourself the very best chance of securing that next role, take a breath and think about whether any of these mistakes apply to you.</p>

                    <h2>Hybrid resumes: a flexible solution for today’s job market?</h2>
                    <p>A hybrid resume – also known as a combination resume – is deployed where a candidate wishes to focus on their skills as well as their work experiences. The skills section is normally a one-word list of top-line abilities, but in a hybrid resume, the section is significantly expanded. It is important that the lines between these two sections do not blur, but in some circumstances, it can be a powerful approach.</p>
                    <p>At a time when more candidates have multiple jobs and increasingly complicated work histories, focusing on skills as well as work experience can potentially be a powerful approach. You do not have to fit your “different” experience into the tight confines of a standard resume. Employers understand the diversity of career paths, so feel free to make the right resume choice for your situation.</p>
